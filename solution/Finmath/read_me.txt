This project implements a particular case of the Monte Carlo simulation of the stock option prices.
The project uses C++ standard libraries, no third-party libraries have been used.

finmath.cpp

	Initializes and starts Simulator instance

simulator.h / simulator.cpp

	Classes:

		Simulator - implements option price simulation
		Share - represents the stock share proce and behavioral parameters
		NormalDistribution - generates independent random sequences
		CorrelationGenerator - converts the sequences generated by the NormalDistribution instance to the correlated random sequences using Cholesky decomposition

matrix.h / matrix.cpp

	Classes:

		Matrix - implements basic matrix oerations
		CorrelationMatrix - represents correlation coefficients
	
contract_calendar.h / contract_calendar.cpp

	Classes:

		ContractCalendar - represents contract dates and implements date iteration logic
		CalendarItemList - represents the iterable list of trading days
		CalendarItem - represents one trading day
		CalendarMode - specifies what kind of date iteration logic the ContractCalendar should use (iterate over each calendar day or iterate over trading days only)
